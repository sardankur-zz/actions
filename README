To simplify email conversations, an AI assistant in the form of a chrome extension tuned to gmail Web-Client, uses a classifier built using machine learning to find question that needs to be answered/replied. These are further bucketed into certain types of questions which are mapped to UI elements. For eg., a boolean question is mapped to a checkbox, an open ended question is mapped to a input text box etc.

Technologies used :
- Scikit (python)
